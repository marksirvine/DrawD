# DrawD
DrawD is a image drawing website where you attempt to draw given images. Then users are able to view, rate and make comments about all the drawings that have been made in the community.

DrawD runs on a raw node.js server and uses a SQL database. Most of the website is written in Javascript, HTML5 and CSS3, however some parts of the feed uses the AngularJS framework and JQuery library.
